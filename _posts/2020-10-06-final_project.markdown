React and redux have definitely tught me a lot more about the freedom JavaScript offers, as well as the useful tools they provide for comparmentalization, separation of concerns, and the use of objects throughout an application. It's nice to see the ways that React can help to separate everything in a JavaScript project to help with organizaion, speed, and access. It makes intuitive sense to work with Object Oriented Jacascript and have everything separated into its specific category of objects and components and then the internal purposes within. This definitely seems like something that comes more and more in handy the larger an application gets.

Using Redux to create a store that is accessible both directions through all components of the application also seems like a naturally intuitive development of Javascript. Using OO with Redux seems to have a lot of benefits relating to speed, again, especially with larger scale applications.

It was also helpful to see further illustration of how these elements tie in with a Ruby based back end. The organizational components and serializers and controllers all make a lot of sense when simplified to work with a JavaScript front end. I definitely appreciate all of the freedom in naming and organization this approach gives the coder, and look forward to learning how this will apply ro massive scale applications.
